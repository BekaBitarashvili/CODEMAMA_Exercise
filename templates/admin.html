    Deep within the archives of Astra Corp, a legendary piece of code remained unsolved. It was rumored that the first
    administrator of the system, a mysterious figure known only as Delta, had left a hidden key—one that could unlock
    the company’s most valuable secrets.

    Many had tried to break the code, but all had failed. The security measures were too advanced, and the system only
    responded to a single word—one that had been forgotten over time.

    One evening, a young intern named Ivy stumbled upon an old document. It described a name that was never spoken, a
    fragment of a title that once belonged to the great guy. Intrigued, she sat before the terminal and typed: ...
    <br><br>

    Nothing happened at first. Then, the screen flickered. Lines of ancient code scrolled rapidly, and a message
    appeared:<br><br>

    "🎉 You found it! Congrats! 🎉"<br><br>

    A hidden vault opened behind her, revealing a notebook filled with algorithms ahead of their time. Ivy had done
    it—she had unearthed the secret left behind by the lost admin.

    And with that, a new era of Astra Corp had begun.
